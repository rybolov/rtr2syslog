# Config for rsyslogd, this is the standard syslogd on Debian.
# rsyslogd supports property-based filters which means we can look for messages
# with $syslogident (set in config.php) in them.
# Drop this file in /etc/rsyslogd.d/
# Default is "rtr2syslog"
# Uncomment to use:
# :app-name, isequal, "rtr2syslog"	/var/log/rtr2syslog.log



# Config for syslog-ng.  Completely untested. =)
#
# destination d_logfile_rtr2syslog {
#        file
#        (
#        "/var/log/rtr2syslog.log"
#        template("$ISODATE $HOST $PROGRAM <$FACILITY.$PRIORITY> $MSG\n")
#        template_escape(yes)
#        );
#        };
#
# Program name is set by $syslogident in config.php
# filter f_rtr2syslog { program ("rtr2syslog"); };
#
# Assumes you have s_input defined in the config earlier!!!
# log { source (s_input); filter (f_rtr2syslog); destination (d_logfile_rtr2syslog); };
