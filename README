If you have an RTR line that makes errors, send it to me.
Line elements 5, 11, 12, and 14 have complex regexp and I might have missed some
valid line characters.

To install:
Untar
Configure:
    cp config.php.sample config.php
    vi config.php
For syslog setup:
    Set $syslogident in config.
    Add a line to /etc/syslog.conf or comparable, look in syslogconfig.txt for samples
    

    
Troubleshooting:
Use logtest.php to test php => syslog or php => directlogfile config
Turn on $debugresponse in config.php if you're watching "on the wire"
Turn on $debug in config.php to "error"
Debug log: tail -f <debug.log>
Unfiltered logs: tail -f /var/log/messages
Filtered logs: tail -f </var/log/rtr2syslog.log>
